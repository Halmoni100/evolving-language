notes

- DQN is able to learn - see simple and simple_spread_1agent_maxcycle300

- maxcycle param needs tuning - reward doesn't show trend of convergence under smaller maxcycle (25, 100, 200), using simple_spread 1agent/3agents

- plots to generate:
    - no copier vs with copier (episode lookback 20, 50, 100)
    - number of agents: 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20
    - different environments (currently using simple_spread)
